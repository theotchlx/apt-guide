# A concise guide to APT

Maybe you're using Linux because it's free, or because it's more secure, or because it doesn't have eyes on you. Or maybe you're a nerd for information technologies and you want to use Linux.  
Whatever the reason, you're here because you want to know how to install software on your Linux system, and you keep seeing terminal commands that you don't understand.

This guide answers some common use cases for Linux users:
- How do I install software easily?
- How do I update my software to the latest version?
- How do I remove software that I no longer need?

Turns out all of this is pretty easy. And you don't need to remember commands or whatever - they're all written down on this guide for you, sorted by use case, and so simple that you may have remembered them by the time you're done typing them once or twice.
